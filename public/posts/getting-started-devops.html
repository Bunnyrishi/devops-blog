                <h2>What is DevOps?</h2>
                <p>DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that emphasizes collaboration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. It aims to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives.</p>
                
                <h2>Core DevOps Principles</h2>
                <h3>1. Collaboration and Communication</h3>
                <p>Breaking down silos between development and operations teams to foster better communication and shared responsibility.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Automation</h3>
                <p>Automating repetitive tasks including testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning to reduce human error and increase efficiency.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</h3>
                <p>Implementing automated pipelines that continuously integrate code changes and deploy them to production environments.</p>
                
                <h2>Essential DevOps Tools</h2>
                <h3>Version Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Git:</strong> Distributed version control system</li>
                    <li><strong>GitHub/GitLab:</strong> Git repository hosting services</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>CI/CD Tools</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Open-source automation server</li>
                    <li><strong>Azure DevOps:</strong> Microsoft's DevOps platform</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Containerization</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Docker:</strong> Container platform</li>
                    <li><strong>Kubernetes:</strong> Container orchestration</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Getting Started: Your First Steps</h2>
                <h3>1. Learn Linux Basics</h3>
                <p>Most DevOps tools run on Linux. Start with basic commands, file systems, and shell scripting.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Master Git</h3>
                <p>Version control is fundamental. Learn Git commands, branching strategies, and collaborative workflows.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Practice with Containers</h3>
                <p>Learn Docker basics: creating images, running containers, and managing volumes.</p>
                
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>DevOps is more than just tools and technologiesâ€”it's a cultural shift that emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement. Start with the fundamentals, practice regularly, and gradually build your expertise.</p>
